#POJOCSS.js

Don't be confused.  This is a Javascript library for building CSS files.  Yes, I know:  "What?"

This is about exploring what expressing CSS rulesets as Plain ol' Javascript Objects could bring to the experience of building stylesheets for your webapps.

What have I discovered so far?  Explicit referencing, real modules, abstract classes(rulesets that aren't output into the final stylesheet), overwrite checking, imperative or functional creation of classes, and more.
